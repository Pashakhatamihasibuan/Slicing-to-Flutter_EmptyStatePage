# Empty State Pages - Slicing Figma to Flutter

This project implements two Empty State pages taken from Figma designs and converted into Flutter code. The Empty State pages include:

1. **Boost Profit Page:** A page that displays a profit growth chart with appealing 3D elements. This page showcases how the provided tools help businesses grow faster.
2. **Success Order Page:** A page that displays a success message after an order is placed. This page confirms to users that their order will be delivered soon.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The pages are designed to look great across different screen sizes.
- **Custom Widgets:** Several custom widgets were created to achieve the desired design.
- **Smooth Animations:** Smooth animations enhance the user experience.
